Idk doing things, messing with unofficial API for Hell Divers 2

Will output similar to:

Faction: Terminids
Message: Scorching temperatures, high winds, and low precipitation cause a near-constant cycle of fires to sweep this planet, punctuated by short bursts of lush rebirth between infernos.


Name: Malevelon Creek
Faction: Automatons
Message: The strange subversion of photosynthesis that sustains the oddly-hued flora that flourishes on this planet remains an intriguing mystery to Super Earth's greatest exo-biologists.


Name: Vandalon IV
Faction: Automatons
Message: A rocky, lonely moon with extremely valuable mineral deposits underneath the surface.


Name: Nivel 43
Faction: Terminids
Message: The lifeless grey of this planet is interrupted only by the violet flowers that grow from strange, parasitic outcroppings.


Name: Ubanea
Faction: Automatons
Message: A crimson algae has propagated wildly across this entire planet, coating its rocky hills with a constant red that masks the spilt blood of the heroes who defend it from tyranny.


Name: Omicron
Faction: Terminids

Plan on adding more and possibly porting this functionality to a Discord bot for the actual output.
